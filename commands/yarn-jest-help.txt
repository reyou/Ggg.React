  --automock                      Automock all files by default.       [boolean]
  --bail, -b                      Exit the test suite immediately upon the first
                                  failing test.                        [boolean]
  --browser                       Respect the "browser" field in package.json
                                  when resolving modules. Some packages export
                                  different versions based on whether they are
                                  operating in node.js or a browser.   [boolean]
  --cache                         Whether to use the transform cache. Disable

                                  (CI) mode. This option is on by default in
                                  most popular CI environments. It will  prevent
                                  snapshots from being written unless explicitly
                                  requested.          [boolean] [default: false]

                                  between every test. Equivalent to calling
                                  jest.clearAllMocks() between each test.
                                                                       [boolean]

                                  the files that coverage info needs to be
                                  collected from.                       [string]
  --collectCoverageOnlyFrom       Explicit list of paths coverage will be
                                  restricted to.                         [array]
  --color                         Forces test results output color highlighting
                                  (even if stdout is not a TTY). Set to false if

  --config, -c                    The path to a jest config file specifying how
                                  to find and execute tests. If no rootDir is
                                  set in the config, the current directory is
                                  assumed to be the rootDir for the project.
                                  This can also be a JSON encoded value which
                                  Jest will use as configuration.       [string]
  --coverage                      Indicates that test coverage information
                                  should be collected and reported in the
                                  output.                              [boolean]
  --coverageDirectory             The directory where Jest should output its
                                  coverage files.                       [string]

                                  matched against all file paths before
                                  executing the test. If the file pathmatches
                                  any of the patterns, coverage information will
                                  be skipped.                            [array]
  --coverageReporters             A list of reporter names that Jest uses when
                                  writing coverage reports. Any istanbul
                                  reporter can be used.                  [array]
  --coverageThreshold             A JSON string with which will be used to
                                  configure minimum threshold enforcement for
                                  coverage results                      [string]
  --debug                         Print debugging info about your jest config.
                                                                       [boolean]

                                  can point to any file or node module.
                                  Examples: `jsdom`, `node` or
                                  `path/to/my-environment.js`           [string]
  --expand, -e                    Use this flag to show full diffs instead of a
                                  patch.                               [boolean]
  --findRelatedTests              Find related tests for a list of source files
                                  that were passed in as arguments. Useful for
                                  pre-commit hook integration to run the minimal
                                  amount of tests necessary.           [boolean]
  --forceExit                     Force Jest to exit after all tests have
                                  completed running. This is useful when

  --haste                         A JSON string with map of variables for the
                                  haste  module system                  [string]
  --json                          Prints the test results in JSON. This mode
                                  will send all other test output and user
                                  messages to stderr.                  [boolean]
  --lastCommit                    Will run all tests affected by file changes in
                                  the last commit made.                [boolean]
  --listTests                     Lists all tests Jest will run given the
                                  arguments and exits. Most useful in a CI
                                  system together with `--findRelatedTests` to
                                  determine the tests Jest will run based on
                                  specific files      [boolean] [default: false]
  --logHeapUsage                  Logs the heap usage after every test. Useful
                                  to debug memory leaks. Use together with
                                  `--runInBand` and `--expose-gc` in node.
                                                                       [boolean]
  --mapCoverage                   Maps code coverage reports against original
                                  source code when transformers supply source
                                  maps.                                [boolean]
  --maxWorkers, -w                Specifies the maximum number of workers the
                                  worker-pool will spawn for running tests. This
                                  defaults to the number of the cores available
                                  on your machine. (its usually best not to
                                  override this default)                [number]
  --moduleDirectories             An array of directory names to be searched
                                  recursively up from the requiring module's

                                  If you require modules without specifying a
                                  file extension, these are the extensions Jest
                                  will look for.                         [array]
  --moduleNameMapper              A JSON string with a map from regular
                                  expressions to module names that allow to stub
                                  out resources, like images or styles with a

                                  search when resolving modules.         [array]
  --noStackTrace                  Disables stack trace in test results output
                                                                       [boolean]

                                  on which files have changed in the current
                                  repository. Only works if you're running tests
                                  in a git repository at the moment.   [boolean]
  --outputFile                    Write test results to a file when the --json

                                  test. Equivalent to calling
                                  jest.resetAllMocks() between each test.
                                                                       [boolean]

                                  file will be reset before running each
                                  individual test.                     [boolean]
  --resolver                      A JSON string which allows the use of a custom

                                  (rather than creating a worker pool of child
                                  processes that run tests). This is sometimes
                                  useful for debugging, but such use cases are
                                  pretty rare.                         [boolean]

                                  regex pattern.                        [string]
  --testPathIgnorePatterns        An array of regexp pattern strings that are
                                  matched against all test paths before
                                  executing the test. If the test path matches
                                  any of the patterns, it will be skipped.
                                                                         [array]
